# Problem 1

``` r

popular_items <- instacart_clean |> 
  group_by(product_name) |> 
  summarize(product_n = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(product_n))
```

The instacart data set contains 1384617 observations and 15 variables.
Each observation corresponds to a product from an order. There are
131209 orders from 131209 users (i.e., one order per user).

Variables include order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered,
user_id, eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day,
days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle,
department. All variables are integers except for 4 character variables.
NA values are not present in the data set.

Across the orders, a total of 39123 distinct products were purchased.
The most purchased item was Banana.

``` r
num_aisle <- instacart_clean |> 
  count(aisle_id) |> 
  nrow()

aisle_items <- instacart_clean |> 
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  summarize(n_items = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(n_items))
```

Customers ordered from 134 different aisles. The top 3 aisles from which
the most items were ordered were fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and
packaged vegetables fruits.

``` r

The top item ordered in the packaged vegetables fruits aisle was organic
baby spinach. In the baking ingredients aisle, light brown sugar was the
most ordered item. Snack sticks chicken & rice recipe dog treats was the
top item ordered in the dog food care aisle.

and Pink Lady Apples were ordered on each day of the week. Overall,
these items were typically ordered between late morning and
mid-afternoon, regardless of the day of the week.

The cleaned brfss data set focusing on the topic of overall health
contains 10625 observations and 23 variables. These data were collected
from 404 counties across the 50 states and Washington, D.C. from 2002 to
2010.

The table below lists the states where 7 or more counties were surveyed
in 2002. Six states met these criteria. Pennsylvania was the highest
with 10 counties surveyed.

The figure above shows the average data value for excellent responses
across the 50 states and Washington, D.C. from 2002 to 2010. The
responses are in relation to the Overall Health topic. Some states show
great variability in the average data value for excellent responses
across this time period.

``` r

  facet_grid(. ~ year)
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sdc2157_files/figure-gfm/ny data values plot-1.png" width="90%" />

The figure above compares the distributions of data values for responses
“Poor” to “Excellent” among counties in NY state during 2006 to those
reported in 2010. The responses are in relation to the Overall Health
topic. Notably, the median data value for “Very good” responses was
greater in 2010 than 2006.

# Problem 3

``` r
demographic_clean <- demographic_raw |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>

         education = as.factor(education)
         ) |>

                      "1" = "male", 
                      "2" = "female"),
         education = recode(education, 
             "1" = "Less than high school",

  filter(age >= 21)

accel_clean <- accel_raw |> 
  janitor::clean_names()

combined_accel <- left_join(demographic_clean, accel_clean, by = "seqn")
```

Our combined data set contains 228 observations and 1445 variables. The
data set describes the demographics and the MIMS activity per minute
over a 24 hr time period for each of the 228 participants.

The table below shows the number of males and females in each of the
educational categories. Most males and females received more than a high
school education.

``` r
combined_accel |> 
  group_by(education, sex) |> 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = n_obs,
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| education              | male | female |
|:-----------------------|-----:|-------:|
| Less than high school  |   27 |     28 |
| High school equivalent |   35 |     23 |
| More than high school  |   56 |     59 |

``` r
combined_accel |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90),
    limits = c(0, 90)
  ) +
  labs(title = "Age distribution of males and females by education received",
       y = "Age (years)",

  facet_grid(. ~ education)
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sdc2157_files/figure-gfm/education sex age plot-1.png" width="90%" />

The figure above shows the age distribuion of males and females by
education received. Among those who received less than a high school
education, the median age of males and females was similar. Among those
who received the equivalent of a high school education, the median age
of females was greater than males. Among those who received more than a
high school education, the median age of females was slightly less than
that of males.

``` r
combined_accel |>
  mutate(total_activity = rowSums(across(min1:min1440))) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +

  labs(
    title = "Total MIMS activity across age for males and females",

  facet_grid(education ~ .) 
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sdc2157_files/figure-gfm/total activity plot-1.png" width="90%" />

The figure above shows total MIMS activity across age for males and
females. Among those who received the equivalent of a high school
education and those who received more than a high school education,
females generally had a higher total activity level than males across
ages 21-80 years. In contrast, among those who received less than a high
school education, females tended to have a higher total activity level
until age 40; after age 40, males had a higher total activity level than
females.

```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sdc2157_files/figure-gfm/mims over time plot-1.png" width="90%" />

The figure above shows the MIMS for males and females over a 24 hr
period by education received. The 24 hr time period started at midnight.
Generally, most people were active during the day. The MIMS activity for
males and females who received more than a high school education
displays a dramatic uptick at minute 500 and minute 8000.
